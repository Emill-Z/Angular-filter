This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Also I used https://miragejs.com/ for mock API. This server (server.ts) will start with the angular app.
